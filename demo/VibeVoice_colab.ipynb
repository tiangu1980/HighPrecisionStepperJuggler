Please note that T4 can only use SDPA instead of flash_attention_2, which may result in unstable and lower audio quality. For the best TTS experience, we recommend trying the 7B model on a more powerful GPU.\n"

        "Speaker 4: It's a cozy Saturday afternoon. Alice, Carter, and Frank are sitting at a café table, planning their big Greek adventure. Laptops open, coffee cups half-full, and Alice already has a notebook covered with doodles of olive branches and little temples.\n",
        "Speaker 1: Okay, first things first-Athens! The cradle of democracy, birthplace of philosophy, land of gyros and feta cheese. We have to start there.\n",
        "Speaker 2: You just sound like a travel brochure already. Did you secretly get hired by the Greek Ministry of Tourism?\n",
        "Speaker 1: If they paid me in baklava, I'd take the job! Anyway, we'll start with the Acropolis. Can you imagine walking up where Socrates and Plato once debated?\n",
        "Speaker 2: Yeah, I imagine Socrates would look at my sneakers and go, \"Really? That's your toga alternative?\"\n",
        "Speaker 3: Hey, at least you're wearing shoes. Half the tourists I see in Athens are trying to climb marble stairs in flip-flops. It's like an Olympic sport called \"Sprained Ankle 101.\"\n",
        "Speaker 1: Haha. True. But besides the Acropolis, we should check out the Parthenon. It was dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom. The columns are still standing after 2,500 years!\n",
        "Speaker 2: Yeah, meanwhile my IKEA bookshelf didn't last two months.\n",
        "Speaker 3: That's because you didn't sacrifice a goat to Athena before assembling it.\n",
        "Speaker 1: Stop! Okay, but food-Carter, you'll love souvlaki. Tender grilled meat on skewers. And saganaki, which is basically cheese set on fire at your table.\n",
        "Speaker 2: Flaming cheese? Okay, Greece officially understands me.\n",
        "Speaker 3: Next stop: Delphi. The ancient Greeks thought it was the center of the world, right?\n",
        "Speaker 1: Yes! The Oracle of Apollo. People traveled from all over just to hear cryptic advice. Like, \"You'll win if you don't lose.\" Super helpful.\n",
        "Speaker 2: So basically the same as a modern motivational poster.\n",
        "Speaker 1: Heehee. Exactly. But the ruins are incredible-the Temple of Apollo, the theater with mountain views. You feel like the gods are still listening.\n",
        "Speaker 3: And don't forget the food. The mountain villages nearby? Honey, nuts, homemade yogurt. You'll eat something simple like bread with olive oil, and it tastes like heaven.\n",
        "Speaker 2: If the oracle told me \"Your destiny is carbs,\" I'd be like, \"Finally, some accurate prophecy.\"\n",
        "Speaker 1: Meteora is going to blow your mind. Monasteries perched on top of giant rock pillars-like castles in the clouds.\n",
        "Speaker 2: Okay but... how do monks even get groceries up there?\n",
        "Speaker 3: They used to haul supplies with ropes and baskets. Imagine being the delivery guy: \"Here's your pizza, please don't drop me.\"\n",
        "Speaker 1: Haha. Those monasteries are UNESCO sites now. We'll climb up and see Byzantine frescoes that survived centuries.\n",
        "Speaker 2: I'm more motivated by the \"climb down and eat moussaka\" part.\n",
        "Speaker 3: Good choice. Moussaka-layers of eggplant, meat, and béchamel sauce. It's basically Greek lasagna, but better.\n",
        "Speaker 3: Ah, Thessaloniki. My favorite food city. Street markets full of bougatsa-sweet custard pie wrapped in flaky pastry. You'll eat one, then accidentally eat three more.\n",
        "Speaker 1: And history too! Roman forums, Byzantine churches, Ottoman baths. Every empire left its mark.\n",
        "Speaker 2: So it's like the European version of my old hard drive-cluttered with everything.\n",
        "Speaker 3: Exactly. But tastier. And at night, the waterfront fills with music. You'll hear rebetiko songs-kind of like Greek blues.\n",
        "Speaker 1: Romantic! We'll sit by the sea, eating fresh seafood, maybe grilled octopus.\n",
        "Speaker 2: As long as it doesn't still look like it could hug me back.\n",
        "Speaker 1: Now the iconic one: Santorini. White houses, blue domes, sunsets that make Instagram crash.\n",
        "Speaker 2: I'm already seeing the photos: \"nofilter living my best life.\"\n",
        "Speaker 3: It's true. Oia at sunset is one of those bucket-list moments. But warning: crowds. Everyone's elbowing each other for that one picture.\n",
        "Speaker 1: Then we'll sneak off and find a taverna. Tomato fritters, fava bean dip, local white wine. Simple, fresh, perfect.\n",
        "Speaker 2: Finally, a meal that doesn't start with \"fried cheese explosion.\"\n",
        "Speaker 3: Don't worry, we'll still get fried cheese tomorrow.\n",
        "Speaker 3: Crete is a whole trip by itself, but we'll squeeze in highlights. Knossos Palace-the legendary labyrinth of King Minos. Some say the Minotaur was kept there.\n",
        "Speaker 2: Great, so basically \"Airbnb but with a monster roommate.\"\n",
        "Speaker 1: The palace is fascinating-Minoan frescoes of dolphins and dancers. They were advanced for 3,500 years ago!\n",
        "Speaker 3: And Crete's food... oh boy. Dakos-barley rusk topped with tomato and feta. Fresh fish straight from the sea. And raki, the local spirit.\n",
        "Speaker 2: What's the alcohol percentage?\n",
        "Speaker 3: High enough that after two shots, you'll start believing you are the Minotaur.\n",
        "Speaker 1: Final day-Mykonos. Beaches, windmills, nightlife.\n",
        "Speaker 2: So this is the \"party like Dionysus\" portion of the trip?\n",
        "Speaker 3: Exactly. We'll stroll through Little Venice, where houses sit right on the water. Then by night, the clubs go wild.\n",
        "Speaker 1: But I want to try kopanisti cheese. Spicy, tangy, totally different from feta.\n",
        "Speaker 2: I'm noticing a trend: every stop involves cheese.\n",
        "Speaker 3: Hey, if Greece invented democracy and theater, the least they could do is also perfect dairy.\n",
        "Speaker 1: So seven days: Athens, Delphi, Meteora, Thessaloniki, Santorini, Crete, Mykonos. History, food, sunsets, parties. Perfect balance.\n",
        "Speaker 2: And enough cheese to keep me happy for the rest of my life.\n",
        "Speaker 3: That's the spirit. Greece: come for the ruins, stay for the raki.\n",
        "Speaker 4: And so, their Greek adventure is set. Laughter, myths, and plenty of flaming cheese await.\n",
